# Games in Java - Object-Oriented Programming with JavaFX

Hi, I'm Peter. I created this project
to show my idea about
how to use **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts
in Java using JavaFX through a series of popular game examples. 

I have an youtube channel as well https://www.youtube.com/@code_quality_principles

### Course Overview

This course, *Mastering Object-Oriented Programming in Java*, 
is designed to teach and reinforce the foundational concepts of **OOP in Java**. 
Through 104 structured lessons, you’ll gain both theoretical and practical skills essential for real-world applications.

### Course Structure

Each lesson is organized into three main sections:
- **Theory**: Deep dive into OOP concepts, such as **classes and objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism,** and **exception handling**.
- **Practice**: Practical examples to demonstrate how each concept is implemented in Java.
- **Exercises**: Coding tasks to reinforce learning and boost problem-solving skills.

### Feedback & Improvement

Every solution you submit receives detailed, personalized feedback. This focuses on best practices and areas for improvement, ensuring continuous growth and a deep understanding of Java's OOP principles.

### Join for free

In order to promote my course I have decided to start it for free,
so if you want to join my course contact me on email: parsentev@yandex.ru

How it will work. I will send you one lesson by email. Each lesson contains: theory, exercises and task.
You have to solve the task and send it back to me so I can check it and give you feedback.
